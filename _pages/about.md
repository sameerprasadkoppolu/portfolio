I'm Sameer Koppolu, a Master's student in Data Science at Northeastern University. With a diverse background in SAP consulting, data analysis, sports writing, and basketball analytics, I aim to leverage data to uncover insights, tell stories, and drive value.

I started my career at Wipro Ltd as an SAP Consultant, contributing to essential components in the ERP system upgrade. This role sparked my interest in data-driven decision-making, leading me to a Data Analyst position at Globalshala, where I evaluated social media marketing campaigns. My passion for sports also saw me penning articles as a Sports Writer at Essentially Sports.

In the Summer of 2023, I interned at SaiX, where I developed a Proof of Concept for Peer Group Analysis using unsupervised ML and data mining techniques. In 2024, I joined the Indiana Pacers as a Basketball Analytics Intern, contributing to an in-house win projection system and building a model to project three-point shooting performance for NBA Draft prospects.

With a robust skill set in data science and experience across various domains, I am dedicated to uncovering insights and creating value through data. My strong analytical abilities, hands-on experience with machine learning, and passion for problem-solving make me a great fit for a Data Science role. I am committed to using my expertise to drive impactful solutions and support data-driven decision-making in any organization.
