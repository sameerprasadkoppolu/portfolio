## Introduction:
One effective technique for thwarting cybercrime is anomaly detection in user authentication. Analyzing the keystroke dynamics of people typing the same text—a seemingly rou-
tine action that has minute individual differences—is one in-
triguing method. This method can produce a distinct profile
of each user's typing habit by recording and evaluating char-
acteristics like dwell time, flight time, and keystroke se-
quence. Even in cases where the attacker has the right cre-
dentials, this profile serves as the benchmark for identifying
deviations and may point to abnormalities that could be
signs of attempted illegal access. This continuous, non-in-
trusive authentication technique has a lot of promise to im-
prove online environment security, especially when paired
with additional security measures.
