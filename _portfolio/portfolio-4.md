## Introduction:
With Soccer (or Football) fans so large in number all across the globe, the world tunes in whenever a major event in the sport takes place. Be it at the club or international level, fans throng in support of their favorite teams, and a big part of these teams are the players who represent them. Therefore, it is with no surprise that when the transfer window opens, the world is curious to know what the new player-team pairings will be.  

But what if a team isnâ€™t able to sign their primary target player? What are their alternative options that are similar to their primary target? It is in light of this that I have built a simple player recommendation system that suggests the Top 10 most similar players for a given input player using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a Self Organizing Map (SOM) using Cosine Distance and Bray-Curtis Distance.
